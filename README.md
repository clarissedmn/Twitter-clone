# Twitter clone

In this exercice, you'll have to create a twitter in a mono repo with the stack of your choice. Folder structure and code guidelines are not imposed.

For each feature of the project, you'll have to create a branch that'll be merged into `main` when the feature is done.

**As a user, I want to be able to:**

## 1 - See a list of tweets

The home page should display a list of tweets, with pagination or infinite scrolling. These tweets will only contains text and will only have 280 characters max.

## 2 - Post a new tweet

An input with a name and the content of the tweet should be displayed at the top of the home page. When clicking to the submit button, the new tweet should be added to the database. Moreover, the new tweet should be displayed on the home page without having to reload the page.

## 3 - Reply to a tweet

Each tweet should have its own page and should have replies displayed under the list. Moreover, the user should be able to add a new reply for this tweet.

## 4 - Sign up/log in into the app

Use Firebase to create a basic authentication process to let the user sign up and log in into the app.

## 5 - Sort and filter the list of tweets

Tweets and tweets replies can be sorted by date and filtered author.
